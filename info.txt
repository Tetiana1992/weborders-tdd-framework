TDD(Test Driven Development) Framework

Do not confuse TDD with DDT(Data-Driven Testing) - Running the same tests with different data inputs. An example is DataProvider




TDD Framework Building steps:
1.Create a maven project
2.Add the necessary dependencies
3.Add project specific .gitignore file
#.gitignore file should be added to the project BEFORE tracking the project with git
4.Create the package structure
5.Add your test cases following the Page Object Model
6.Add xml files for running tests (regression, smoke)
7.Add and configure the Base class
8.Add properties file and ConfigReader Utility class to read from the file
9.Add other utilities (Driver, SeleniumUtils, CSVReader)
10.Add headless browser support
11.



TDD TestNG Framework components:
Java (version 17) -> writing framework code
Maven(version 3.9.6)-> manage framework structure, dependencies. Execute tests through command line.
Selenium WebDriver(version 4.39) -> create UI tests
TestNG (version 7.11)-> run the tests, configure and organize tests cases via xml file and annotations
Faker -> mock data generation
Commons IO - IO operations
IntelliJ -> develop, run, test the framework code, fix the errors, speed up the development process
Git/GitHub -> version control, remote repository, code collaboration
.gitignore -> ignore unnecessary files to prevent merge conflicts
testng xml file -> configure/organize/group our tests cases
.properties file -> stores project specific global data/variables
utility classes( ConfigReader, Driver, SeleniumUtils) -> store commonly used methods
Framework Base Class -> store common setup and teardown operations for all test cases

Design Pattern used in this Framework:

Singleton -> design pattern applied to Driver class to ensure a single WebDriver instance during the test execution
Page Object Model - design pattern used in UI test framework to reduce repeated code and improve maintainability
Steps:
-create a class for each page og the app, and add the webelements there with @FindBy annotations
-Use the page class in your test by creating the object of the class and accessing the webelements through getters or suing the methods
Page Factory - a technique of implementing Page Object Model in a more readable and efficient way:
We use @FindBy annotations for Webelements and use PageFactory.initElements(dRiver.getDriver(), this) in the constructor of the class
